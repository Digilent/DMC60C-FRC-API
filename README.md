DMC60C FRC API

First connect the roboRIO to your PC's network.
Run "Install DMC60C libraries and config utility.bat".
To install the DMC60C configuration utility, press either 1 or 2 then press enter.
Press enter to input the default user name, and enter again to input the default password (blank)
The script will copy the configuration utility files over and run the install script on the roboRIO.
It will then copy the DMC60C.json file to your FRC VSCode directory.
If Labview is installed, the DMC60C Labview VI library will be copied into user libraries.
